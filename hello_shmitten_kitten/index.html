<h2>Dear Anna,</h2>
<p>
    There is so much I have to tell you: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We have the same name! (ANNA!!!)</li>
        <li>We are both around the same height! (I am 6'1", fyi.)</li>
    </ol>
<p>On a less creepy front, I found out about your blog when I started dating my boyfriend, about 10 months ago.  I was <em>immediately</em> impressed and excited.  I bought your book.  I follow you on tumblr.  Maybe those weren't less creepy...</br></br>
Below you will find some thoughts that you have inspired me to share.  I have spent my life being single and being disappointed with dating, only recently have I found one that is worthy (he's 49% gay, basically).  It's very surprising!<br>
</p>

<h3 class="shmitten">Good things about my boyfriend</h3>

<p>When he wants to watch Gossip Girl or Say Yes to the Dress (AND drink too much wine)</br>

<p>What I feel look like when he talks about blow jobs.</br>

<p>When my boyfriend suggests I take a day a "personal day" from work (and I go shopping).</br>

</p></br>

<p>When a salacious man walks by and I forget what I'm doing.</br>

<h3 class="shmitten">Less good things that I am <em>definitely</em> not holding grudges about (DON'T READ THIS, DAN)</h3>

<p>When he starts talking about work when we jump in to bed (seriously, boner killer).</br>

</p></br>

<p>How I look when he wants me to meet an old thing that is now a good friend (<a href= "http://bukk.it/wat2.jpg">lolwut</a>).</br>

</p></br>

<p>When he bails early from work and we cant take the train together and he asks me if its fine to meet up later and I'm <em>totally</em> ok with that.  I'm not an overly attached girlfriend.</br>

<p>About me:
    <ol>
        <li>Self proclaimed wine expert (if it costs less than $15 and comes in sizes at least 1.5L bottles),</li>
        <li>Trekkie (but really only TNG),</li>
        <li>Lived in NYC for 1.5 years-ish but am a PNW homebrew,</li>
        <li>Dropped out of physics grad school to discover the truth about gifs (ie, I work at <a href="http://bitly.com">bitly</a> as a scientist),</li>
        <li>I've been having issues with UTI's lately so my bf and I made a drink called a UTI, short for "U're Totes Intoxicated", that is 1 part cranberry juice, 1 part tonic, and 1 part gin,</li>
        <li>Apparently I like lists.</li>
