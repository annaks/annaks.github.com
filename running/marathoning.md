### Resources

This is my bible for running, in general and specifically for marathons: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I6D6WG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1

### Training Things

My general rules for training which I've learned (or validated ):

- During any given week, no more than 50% of mileage to come from long run (this gets particularly important and hard to do as you get upwards of 17+ miles).  Shoot for running 4 +/- 1 times a week. 
- Increase long runs 1-2 miles week over week.
- Spend a lot of time around 16-18 miles (this is my wall).
- My max is usually 22 miles 3 weeks before the marathon.
- For anything over 10 miles, I do 11 minute intervals of 10 minutes running + 1 min walking.  Adjust as needed as runs get longer, eg I'll decrease time running to 7 min running with 1 min of walking).
- For longer runs, I'm likely to break them up into two runs within 24 hours of each other (either same day or two consecutive days) given time constraints or pain. 


### Food

- Play with your food intake to find what you like to eat and how often.  I've found I like 1/2 a nut-butter pouch every hour or so (any of Justin's are great - especially the hazelnut ;).  
- Other things I've liked in the past are cliff shot blocks.
- Recently I've been trying to get into a Keto/low-carb diet for marathons.  Its super helpful in avoiding "the wall" but is a pain to stick to and takes a few weeks of patience/sluggishness before it kicks in.
- Keto diets can also help with moods in general. [Some more info if you care to pursue it.](http://eatingacademy.com/how-a-low-carb-diet-affected-my-athletic-performance)


### Liquids

- For drinks, usually stick with water unless I'm going more than 3 hours - then I'll have something like watered down Vitamin Water in my water bottle and use water fountains for plain water.  
- Finding a good water bottle is key!  I prefer handheld ones that can hold my calories for a supported race.  Find what works best for you.

### Clothing

- You know how to do

### Shoes

I don't change my footwear across training vs daily running.  I run on pretty flat shoes like Nike 5.0 or anything else with very minimal (but some) cushioning.  Get a few pairs of shoes to find what you like best and what minimizes little aches and pains.

### Stretching?!!?!

As I've gotten older, stretching has become more important :O

### Running Goals

Overall, my goals when I run marathons are:

1. Finish,
2. Run more than I walk, and
3. Dont die (this could be encapsulated by 1 but its best to be explicit).
